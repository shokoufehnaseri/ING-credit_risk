# Task – build a model to predict defaults
Your mission is clear: construct a credit risk model that precisely assesses the probability of default
for the bank’s clients.
Remember, the success of this endeavor hinges on your ability to strike the right balance between
growth and risk management. Let’s build a credit risk model that not only quantifies risk but also
provides actionable insights for informed decision-making.
Armed with the data we’ve meticulously collected, your task is to develop a sound model—one that
empowers Big Lion Bank to expand its business while safeguarding against undue risk. The annual
borrowing data, neatly organized in a CSV file named “credit_data.csv,” awaits your analytical prowess
and include:
1.customer IDs (ID),
2.reporting date (end_date),
3.financial information, such as balance sheet items in the local currency (lions) and financial ratios,
4.The binary target variable taking the value of 1 when a performing company is going to enter the
state of default (e.g., the company will not be able to repay its obligations) during the next 12 months,
and 0 otherwise. We assume that defaulted companies cannot be cured and they stay in default
forever.
All variables are explained in the dictionary file (“description of variables.xlsx”).

# Task – general tips/guidance to the modelling competition

1. Model Evaluation:
- Assess the overall performance of the model, specifically its accuracy in predicting customer defaults for the bank.
- Ensure that the model's predictions align with real-world outcomes.
2. Economic Interpretability:
- Focus on making the model's components economically interpretable.
- Understand how each feature contributes to the model's predictions in terms of financial impact.
3. Data Quality Analysis:
- Thoroughly examine the quality of the data used for analysis.
- Identify any inconsistencies, missing values, or outliers that may affect model performance.
4. Visualizations and Graphs:
- Utilize visualizations and graphs to demonstrate your understanding of the topic.
- Clearly present the results, emphasizing key insights and trends.
5. Creativity in Problem Solving:
- Approach the problem with creativity and innovative thinking.
- Consider alternative solutions and explore unconventional approaches.
6. Code Readability:
- Ensure that your code is well-organized and easy to follow.
- Use meaningful variable names, comments, and proper indentation.
Remember, a thoughtful and thorough analysis will lead to valuable insights and actionable recommendations.
